Supplement to Ruijuan's work:  

Differential expression analysis using sleuth **(To be uploaded)**

Allele-specific expression analysis using MBASED  
**MBASED_F1.rmd** contains all preprocessing, filtering, and statistics. 
**Run_MBASED.R** and **Run_MBASED_Beta.R** are the scripts for actually generating results from MBASED.  
The former assumes a binomial distribution of read counts and the latter assumes a beta-binomial distribution, with rho estimated in **MBASED_F1.rmd**
